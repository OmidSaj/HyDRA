## Introduction
This repository is the official implementation of "Filter Banks and Hybrid Deep Learning Architectures for Performance-based Seismic Assessments of Bridges" by [Seyed Omid Sajedi](https://github.com/OmidSaj) and [Xiao Liang](https://github.com/benliangxiao). Hybrid Deep learning models for Rapid Assessments (HyDRA) is introduced as a multi-branch neural network architecture that enable end-to-end training for different types of processed vibration data structures for structural damage diagnosis.


## Citing this work
This repository includes the implementation and dataset for the following publication, currently under reivew in the journal of Structural Engineering. Publication details will be updated in the near future.
