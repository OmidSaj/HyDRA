## Introduction
This repository is the official implementation of "Filter Banks and Hybrid Deep Learning Architectures for Performance-based Seismic Assessments of Bridges" by [Seyed Omid Sajedi](https://github.com/OmidSaj) and [Xiao Liang](https://github.com/benliangxiao). Hybrid Deep learning models for Rapid Assessments (HyDRA) is introduced as a multi-branch neural network architecture that enable end-to-end training for different types of processed vibration data structures for structural damage diagnosis.

## Acknowledgment
* Parts of the code regarding the extraction of filter banks from the raw signals is based on Haytham Fayek's excellet [tutorial on Speech Processing for Machine Learning](https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html). 
* [Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) tutorial](http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/) by James Lyons is a great resource to obtain deep insight on the theoretical background of filter banks for speech processing.
